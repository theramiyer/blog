<html lang="en"><p>Torrents have never been out of the limelight, nor will they be for the foreseeable future. As long as there’s data, there would be talk of sharing it, and so, torrents will come into picture until they’re replaced by a better technology. But then, thanks to popular misunderstanding, torrents are considered <em>bad</em>, and anyone who backs them is considered a pirate without a second thought. Is this right? You’d think I’d say no. Well, partially. I’d just say that it is not justified to term every torrent user a pirate. That’s not the case. To understand why, let’s look at what torrents really are. And then we’ll also look at whether they should be demonised.</p><a name='more'></a> <h2>What are torrents?</h2> <p>I’m sure everyone understands the word, ‘protocol’. To those who don’t, it’s not that complicated: it is just a set of rules and methods that are followed to accomplish a certain task. So, if you want to buy a pizza, one of the protocols is to call the phone number specified, ask for the menu, listen carefully while the person recites it, choose your pizza, choose the size, choose the toppings, choose the add-ons, choose the sides, and place the order. Then wait for the delivery person to to bring the pizza, open the door when the doorbell rings, accept the pizza, pay him, tip him, and then thank him.</p> <p>Similarly, when it comes to using the Internet, or any technology for that matter, you need a protocol. So yes, your browser uses a protocol to deliver this page to you—it is called the HTTP protocol, or Hypertext Transmission Protocol. You may also see the HTTPS protocol in some places such as Facebook and your bank sites; that is Hypertext Transmission Protocol (Secure).</p> <p>BitTorrent is one such protocol. For analogy, let’s take the ubiquitous HTTP as the candidate of comparison. HTTP typically works as a server-client system, in that the file is present on a server, which you connect to, and initiate the transfer. So the file, in this case, typically gets transferred from the server to your computer. The BitTorrent protocol is a little different: here, the file gets transferred from one client computer to another. You no get what I say? I knew it. I don’t make much sense sometimes.</p> <p>OK, so there’s a server which contains a PDF file that you want to download. You connect to it using HTTP (say, Google Drive). The owner of the file has stored the file on a Google server. Google uses HTTP to transfer the file to you, when you click on the right link. So you connect to the Google server using your browser, and the file transfer is initiated—between the Google server, and your computer. That’s the client-server model. BitTorrent, on the other hand, uses a different approach.</p> <p>On BitTorrent, the files are not stored on a server; only the tracking information is. Let me rephrase it. A file is a combination of 1s and 0s. BitTorrent divides the file into <em>chunks</em> of 1s and 0s, and then keeps track of what chunk is transferred to whom. The server does not store the file itself, but the file is transferred by peers, to peers. In other words, if a few of my friends and I created a video, loaded in onto our computers, and then shared it with everyone instead of uploading it on a server, it would be peer-to-peer transfer. You’d be literally downloading data from our <em>laptops</em>, and not any server, per se. SHAREit is a form of peer-to-peer transfer using the Local Area Network (LAN), Bluetooth transfer is a peer-to-peer transfer over the Bluetooth.</p> <h2>Why torrents?</h2> <p>Why use this system at all? Because it minimises the cost of transfer, drastically—because the storage and transfer part is offloaded to the <em>peers</em>! Typically, when three thousand people connect to a server to download a certain file, the server is overloaded, and the network channel size (bandwidth) should be large enough to cater to the users. For example, let’s say that there are a billion computers trying to download Windows&nbsp;10. The size of the installable is typically about 3.5&nbsp;GB. So, Microsoft has to transfer 3.5&nbsp;billion gigabytes in order to give Windows&nbsp;10 to those billion customers. Let’s say there’s a cluster of a thousand servers to do this, but even then, every server has to transfer three-and-a-half million gigabytes! That’s HUGE load!</p> <p>Now imagine that Microsoft pushed out Windows&nbsp;10 to 10,000 computers directly from the servers. The servers would only have to transfer 35&nbsp;GB each. Now there are a total of 11,000 computers having the Windows&nbsp;10 installation files. These then give another 20,000 computers (10,000 by the 1,000 servers, and 10,000 by the 10,000 home computers who’ve already received Windows&nbsp;10) the files by means of peer-to-peer transfer. Wasn’t the load drastically reduced? The servers have, so far, only transferred 70&nbsp;GB, and the client computers have sent out 3.5&nbsp;GB each. This goes on and the copies multiply, so the load on the server is kept very low. And Microsoft actually did this to distribute Windows&nbsp;10.</p> <h2>Are torrents really bad?</h2> <p>Well, is the Internet bad? There you go. What I’m saying is that torrents are just like the Internet. It depends on what you use them for. For example, the open source GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP, for short), uses the BitTorrent protocol to deliver the download to users, apart from the traditional server-client transfer using HTTP. So no, they’re not bad in this case.</p> <p>However, nothing is all rainbows. Yes, the BitTorrent protocol, today, is <em>also</em> used for transferring pirated software, pirated movie files, pirated music&nbsp;&hellip; you name it.</p> <blockquote> <p>‘Yes, that’s why torrent was shut down.’</p></blockquote> <p>If only I had a nickel for every time I heard or read the comment. Yes, it’s a popular belief that torrent was shut down. No. And I laugh at it every time I hear it (well, if not a nickel, I should be allowed at least a load of laughter). “Shut[ting] down torrents” doesn’t make sense. It’s like saying something like, ‘Closing the sea’. It’s a drastic thing, and I don’t think that’s even possible in its true sense. You cannot just “shut down” a protocol.</p> <blockquote> <p>But then weren’t they banned? Didn’t owners of these sites face legal challenges?</p></blockquote> <p>Of course, they did. Every site such as Kickass Torrents, The Pirate Bay, and every torrent download site you can think of, has faced legal challenges. And that’s one of the primary reasons for the misunderstanding as well. If you notice, each of these sites, supposedly, gave torrents. So how can I say that torrents cannot be shut down? That’s where it confuses people.</p> <p>A torrent file, which is typically what these sites give you, are tiny tracker files. These just keep track of what chunk you download from where. These files are used by the torrent clients (such as BitTorrent, μTorrent, Torrex, etc.) to communicate with the tracker server, and the peers who have the files. Note: the peers have the files. The tracker server allots a tracking number to your download, and decides what packets you should get, and from whom. Well, that’s probably an oversimplified way of saying it, but that’s the concept.</p> <h2>So then what is blocked by my ISP?</h2> <p>The torrent search engines and the public torrent tracker file providers are <em>blocked</em> by your ISPs, by means of discouraging the addition of the DNS entries to these sites. It is like saying that your ISP has the map to different places on the Web—the route to reach these sites. In that sense, the ISP has just erased the areas of the map that contained routes to these places. So you cannot directly go to these sites with their names. But you can still access them—one among the many ways to do this is to know the exact IP address of these sites/servers. But that’s a very long shot, and most don’t do this kind of stuff. And if your ISP has decided to discourage you from accessing these sites, they probably have a very strong reason to do this—they’re doing this despite the high probability of their being considered unpopular, and you should respect that. Also, the law in some countries force the ISPs to do this.</p> <h2>Then, can I not use torrents?</h2> <p>Far from it. You can definitely use torrents, but not the sites that promote online piracy through the use of the BitTorrent protocol. In other words, legitimate torrent transfer is allowed—such as the case of GIMP. If you want to share your work freely, and by means of peer-to-peer communication, you’re free to do that, provided you’re the owner of your work—just like anything on the Internet. So if, say, you made a movie, and would like to give it off to everyone in the world for free, but don’t want to pay some file storage and download provider to do it, you can very well create a torrent file and share it across. The download will first begin from your laptop. Then the copies will multiply. This is legitimate, and is allowed.</p>
