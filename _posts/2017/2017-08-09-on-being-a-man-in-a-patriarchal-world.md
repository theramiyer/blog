I recently read a news report on how the fans of one of South India's leading actors stooped down and [trolled a woman who made a remark on the actor](https://www.buzzfeed.com/soniathomas/vijay-fans-abused-threatened-and-sexually-harassed-a?utm_term=.selp92Yr8#.klooe05Aa). It was disturbing, but not surprising at all. The woman was the Editor-in-Chief of a very popular news outlet in the South. Of course, she didn't keep quiet; she filed a complaint against the trolls. Tonight, I read an [article by Soumya Rajendran](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/contrary-what-some-men-think-being-called-slut-doesnt-destroy-women-66460), about what a woman goes through in our society, since the time she hits puberty.

With a picture of how hostile the world around me is towards women, I sat down to think what a boy goes through in this patriarchal society, and how things only become worse as the years pass.

I remember, when I was a boy, one day, my father, on a walk to the salon, told me that women were to be respected. He told me that we worship the Goddess, and every woman I would come across in my life symbolise her. He had no idea how seriously I would take that statement. And I think he'd be surprised reading this post.

Honestly, the statement didn't hit me on that day. It took me years and years of analysis and minor corrections in thought patterns and behaviour to reach the point I'm at today. And no, I'm certainly not perfect. Not even close, but I'm trying, trying everyday to become a better human being. When I first started thinking about the statement, I quickly told myself that I was a feminist. But as time passed, I realised that I was only fooling myself. I wasn't a feminist---I'm not a feminist---and as of today, I think it's good. How can someone be biased towards one half of mankind? Being a feminist was as wrong as being a male chauvinist.

But why am I writing all this?

Today, an FIR was filed against the Twitter trolls who trolled Dhanya. The actor came forth and told everyone that everyone had the right to criticise work. And one of my friends posted a question on Facebook, on whether rightist trolls should be trolled to discourage such behaviour on the Internet.

My stand on this is that trolling back the trolls is only going to fix a symptom. Or a specific instance of the symptom. The root cause is still left unaddressed. The root cause is the idea that women are somehow inferior to men. That a woman doesn't have the right to question a man's performance. A _root symptom_ is that hurling verbal sexual abuses hurt women more than they hurt men. And such abuses directed towards the women in a man's family hurts the man. Why does the world feel that the woman is at the receiving end of sex? And that that, somehow, is inferior? What sort of idea is that?

The problem is, such questions don't occur to us men easily. Because we're part of a society that has inculcated this sort of ideas into us. We take these for granted. These ideas automatically make us men feel superior to women, and makes women angry because they're made to feel inferior---a sort of passive oppression.

But it is not just women who feel oppressed; men who think of women as equals are also oppressed by the society. It is _less manly_ to think of a woman as an equal. It is simply unacceptable. Which man wants to feel less manly, right? Less manly is more womanly, and that's inferior!

To add to this, we have this twisted idea of (and get this; it's had me so frustrated that I wished I could eliminate all of mankind and bring back Lord Manu to start afresh) respecting our mothers, but not any other woman. Which brings us to my next point of frustration: a woman is respectable only once she becomes a mother. I still don't get that point. I mean, why? Why can't we simply respect the entirety of mankind as fellow beings of the same species?

No, it's difficult for us men. We make shameful statements without realising that they're shameful. When someone points it out, we stop, think about it, want to slap ourselves, and then repent. These things are that deeply etched in our heads. What's more unfortunate is that our women also take these things for granted and pass them on to the next generations.
