Seeking reason for our actions is known to increase passion in what we do. Keeping with the idea, we feel great about how we concluded that the National Anthem should be sung wherever possible. Passionate or not, sometimes, the satisfaction we get from the reasons we find are short-lived. Such was my situation after I'd completed my [previous post]({{ page.previous.url }}).

Going by the binary nature of our contemporary fellow-humans, it's easy for us to conclude that anyone who questions the playing of the National Anthem is antinational---easy, but wrong. During a discussion with one of my friends, I was sent a link to an [article in The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Playing-of-the-national-anthem-and-laws/article16730624.ece), that has some anecdotes from the history of this discussion.

Long story short, the first instance of this debate seems to date back to the 1960s, when the national anthem was played at the end of every movie. However, since viewers used to leave at the end of the movies, and not listen to the Anthem, the practice was stopped. In 2003, the Maharashtra Assembly passed an order which required all the theatres to play the national anthem before the commencement of the movie.

In one of the legal proceedings against "disrespect" to the national anthem, the Supreme Court said that although the citizens are expected to stand to show respect to the national anthem, they are not legally obligated to sing along.

The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act came into existence in 1971 prohibiting anyone from intentionally preventing the singing of the national anthem.

In another mention on the subject, here's what the Home Ministry has to say about the national anthem being played as part of a documentary or a newsreel:

> Whenever the Anthem is sung or played, the audience shall stand to attention. However, when in the course of a newsreel or documentary the Anthem is played as a part of the film, it is not expected of the audience to stand as standing is bound to interrupt the exhibition of the film and would create disorder and confusion rather than add to the dignity of the Anthem.

Apparently, there are specific rules as to when to sing the national anthem, and for whom. There are also rules to when the public can indulge in mass singing the anthem. And apparently, it's left to the "good sense of people" to prevent _indiscriminate singing of the national anthem_. But, who is to decide what is and what's not "indiscriminate singing of the national anthem"?

We talk about not diminishing the dignity of the national anthem by playing or singing it willy-nilly, that's clear. The question now is, does playing the national anthem in theatres diminish its dignity of the anthem?

Losing our way through these conversations is unavoidable. Retracing back to the spot where we talked about the reason we should sing the national anthem, we place our palm on our face, thinking how foolish we're being, by simply patching the symptom rather than addressing the root. The root here, if we understand, is the sense of patriotism. We're trying desperately to bring in a sense of belonging to our country. Do we fear that our citizens may be losing the sense of belonging?

The short answer is, not really. Today, I feel we don't understand the value of patriotism. Or in some cases, we have misunderstood the term. Or perhaps, we have our own ways to be patriotic about our country. To quote Ramachandra Guha from the Bangalore Literature Festival, "patriotism is about how we treat our fellow citizens". So, as long as you perform your duties, respect the Constitution, abide by the laws, contribute towards the betterment of your countrymen, you're more patriotic than most citizens of any nation.

Expression of patriotism, on the other hand, is an iffy topic. Should you express your patriotism? I'm not sure. It's perhaps every individual's decision. But do you go against the law? No. Not standing up for the national anthem is disrespectful, according to the law.

But should the national anthem be played at the beginning of the movie? I don't understand the intent. I would certainly love to stand up for a minute for the anthem, no doubt, but I don't understand the intent. And as far as I'm concerned, it's only being counter-productive.

It's simple: what do we want to achieve by playing the anthem at the beginning of the movie?

1. Giving a sense of patriotism to an already-patriot?
2. Inducing a sense of patriotism to someone not-so-patriot?

This is what these directly translate to:

1. Redundancy.
2. Counter-productivity: the sand-in-the-fist situation from _Dil Chahta Hai_.

We're a great nation. Our heritage is rich. We, in spite of all our ups and downs, are the largest democracy, and we've remained so for decades. We still run pretty well, as a nation, in spite of all the Himalayan challenges we face on a day-to-day basis. We've even led the world in several things over the last several centuries. But how much do we really know about ourselves?

Perhaps understanding who we are and how we've grown over millennia would make us feel proud of ourselves as a country. Shortcuts are better avoided. There are better ways to be patriotic. It won't happen overnight---just like every good thing in the world. But again, that's not to say that the national anthem doesn't make us feel patriotic; I'd probably be the last person in this country to say something like that.

But time and place are the key. Perhaps the Honourable Supreme Court may want to reconsider the order. And people like Kamal Hassan should probably learn to express themselves better, rather than going for cheap publicity stunts.
