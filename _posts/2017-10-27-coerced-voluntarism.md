You get back from work one evening (if you're so lucky), and while having your cup of coffee, made with love, you open up Facebook on your phone to see what's going on around the world, and then, in a few moments, regret the decision, but you're too hooked to let go, because you saw something like, [Befitting reply given to Kamal Hassan by Sadhguru, which stripped the liberal](http://theindianvoice.com/sadhguru-stripped-people-like-kamal-hassan-dont-want-stand-national-anthem/). Online stripping aside, you're now in a state of conflict: should you, or should you not be asked to stand up for the National Anthem?

And then, you look at the comments. You're appalled by how popular thought today, has started to transform things into binary. About how people are becoming more and more polar: it's either there or here; there's no in-between. It's convenient. But healthy? You wonder if we're computers. Quickly, you say you're not. You're more complicated; you're more human, aren't you? But can an answer to this question be _somewhere in between_?

Now that you've called yourself a human, you do your humans-only thing of engaging your intellect. You do what led to the invention of the wheel, or the discovery of fire. And then you spit at how we try hard to move away from this amazing quality. You stray for a while, you dwell there, and then, think how of late we want ideas fed to us, how we don't question anything, how we never try to find answers, or verify the legitimacy of what we've been told. Just like "You should stand for the National Anthem in attention; show some respect." You stop and ask yourself, "Why?" And then quickly check if there are any right-wingers ready to call you an anti-national. And then you think, 'Descent is easier, quicker, even thrilling, but in the end, it's just that: descent.' And then you look around again just to make sure.

Then, you circle back to the situation at hand: in a nutshell, Kamal Hassan tweeted about not forcing people to stand up for the National Anthem in the theatres. Sadhguru, a witty man usually, made a statement about how citizens expect the soldiers to guard the borders, but express displeasure in standing up for fifty-two seconds for the National Anthem. You read it again:

> Singapore plays it's national anthem every midnight.Likewise do so on DD. Do not force or test my patriotism at various random places.\\
---Kaman Hassan | 22:51 on Oct 24, 2017

> You want our Soldiers stand & die on our borders when you are unwilling to stand for 52 sec. -Sg #NationalAnthem @BSF_India @timesofindia\\
---Sadhguru | 17:32 on Oct 25, 2017

You head off to read the entire article; you're hooked, remember?

> \[Sadhguru\] said that nation and the national anthem is an emotion. Just like a family of 4 people cannot stay together without emotion, how can you expect a country of over billion people to stay together if they’re not freely willing to stand up for the national anthem just for 52&nbsp;seconds.

And then you raise your guards (not the sword at the grammatical errors, thankfully) at Hassan's tweet. The words "unwilling" and "freely" capture and hold on to your attention. You now want a reason (a logical one) to disagree with Hassan.

It's second nature for many of us to stand up for the National Anthem. We feel the sense of belonging towards our billion-strong nation, that has seen some of the most turbulent of days; our country, which was a single large empire centuries ago, which later disintegrated into little bits and pieces, and was reunited to form a soft superpower; our country, which, in spite of corrupt politicians and officials, and too many forces pulling it apart, stands strong. We get Goosebumps when we see the massive Tricolour flutter in the night sky at the Jawaharlal Nehru Planetarium. 'It's indeed a subtle but profound feeling', one of our friends says. We smile and nod in agreement. And rub our arms to ease the Goosebumps.

'But,' you say, 'I'm a free citizen in a free country. Should I not be given a choice of whether or not stand up for the National Anthem, or whether or not cinemas be given the right to choose whether or not to play the National Anthem?'

Fair enough, you think. And look around, just to make sure.

'But again,' you think, 'why should we play the National Anthem in the first place?' Looking at the meaning of the Anthem, you think, is a good place to start. You brush aside the rumour started by the same right-wingers a few years ago, about how our National Anthem was written for George&nbsp;IV. You decide to call Republic of India the _Bhārata bhāgya vidhātā_. You also brush aside thoughts of another bunch of right-wingers, who think _Bhārat_ has a religious base, while _Hindustān_ doesn't. Oh, the irony.

Of course, the song is nothing but a praise to all the provinces/regions of the time it was written in. It is a wish for a blessing of a good life from the _Collective Whole_. It is a wish for victory from the enemy, which is primarily whatever stands against the people---the _Jana Gaṇa_.

Sure, you're neither arrogant nor foolish to say that that's the only interpretation, but that's the interpretation we get from our limited knowledge of Sanskrit. And the interpretation we can easily connect to.

Quickly, you realise that the concept is simple: remind us that we're part of a greater whole, we're all governed by it, and we govern it: the largest democracy in the world. To remind us to put the nation before the person (part of the reason why we ignore minor discomforts in some rare cases, and stand still). And to bring the sense of oneness in us.

You slowly come back to thinking how twisted it is that we have to be _asked_ to stand up for the National Anthem. You think whether there's so much indifference in us that:

1. The government has to ask us to play the National Anthem,
2. The government has to ask us to stand up for the National Anthem,
3. People have to tweet about the whole concept of standing for the National Anthem, and,
4. Someone has to write such posts, thinking aloud, whether we should stand for the National Anthem.

To answer the question on whether the government has the right to enforce standing up for the National Anthem, it does not. The government is still equal to the people---the Collective Whole---if not below. Citizens should have the freedom to decide whether or not they want to stand up for the National Anthem.

However...

It's shameful that we as citizens should be _asked_ to stand up for the National Anthem, or play the National Anthem in the first place. It gives an impression that we cannot even voluntarily remember facts that we should as citizens, that we consider ourselves bigger than the Collective Whole---that we, as individuals, cannot even set aside our individual activities for mere fifty-two&nbsp;seconds. Shame.

That's the in-between. Question the concept of the government asking us to stand up for the National Anthem---by all means. But also introspect about the concept. Try to understand why you feel you should not stand for the National Anthem. But of course, condemn everyone who holds back your rights. Think as a citizen, not a mere person.
