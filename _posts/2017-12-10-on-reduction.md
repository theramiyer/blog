> One language, one religion, and one common enemy.

Historian and columnist Ramachandra Guha did an hour-long talk on how nationalism is a nineteenth-century European phenomenon, and how Indian nationalism was founded on the exact opposite principles.

He went on to say how we seem to be gradually moving towards the said model of European nationalism, by looking for _one_ language, _one_ religion, and _one_ common enemy. Keeping aside the common enemy part for a whole book, I thought I'd focus on the more relatable "one language" and "one culture" parts.

Digressing a little, I also read [another piece from The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-genetics-is-settling-the-aryan-migration-debate/article19090301.ece), which suggests with evidence about how diversity is literally in our DNA.

**Note**: Tread carefully. If you're too emotional, don't read that piece. What follows is a watered-down version of it.

**Disclaimer**: Scientific studies are based on evidences. Unearthing of new evidences can possibly change the exact details of what's been believed as true.

In other words, we do not, even genetically, conform to _one kind_.

And yet, if you see today, we are trying desperately hard to go towards "One". We all want "one" way of life. And we want "the best" way of life. Talk about confining infinity into a matchbox!

Many of us, as we go about our daily morning business, find something to read at the time. I picked Quora today. And I don't know if it was because I told Quora, I know Tamil and I live in India, that I got this myriad of questions about Tamil Nadu. At first, it was interesting to see how people from different states who live in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu, defended Chennai in specific and Tamil Nadu overall (contrary to popular belief that people hate these regions). The open-mindedness truly touched my heart. Who doesn't love their hometown being defended, right?

But slowly, it started becoming a drag probably because I continued to read as I went about other things this morning. Polarity. Chauvinism. Bias. (Polarity and bias are two different things.) Prejudice. Pride.

There were questions as ridiculous as "[Why did Malaysia and Singapore choose a decrepit language like Tamil as one of their official languages instead of Hindi?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Malaysia-and-Singapore-choose-a-decrepit-language-like-Tamil-as-one-of-their-official-languages-instead-of-Hindi?srid=pKBV)"

I don't know why, but there's a lot of bias towards (and more prominently against) languages, in India. We somehow don't want to celebrate the fact that we're the _only_ country in the world to have this many languages in a single piece of land. We want to confine ourselves not even to twenty-two official languages, but one. Yeah, go ahead, just reduce ourselves!

### The History

Historically, we've been far from that. But let's address this so-called "purity" first. To set the stage, I'm against the idea of "_the_ indigenous language of India" theory that my fellow Tamils talk about, Tamil is definitely _one of the indigenous languages_ of our subcontinent, and it has a proven history to talk for itself. While it is rightfully disputed to be _the oldest_ language of India, it is definitely (and significantly) older than many Indian languages. But I don't think it is _the oldest_. I don't even know if something like "This is the oldest language available" can be conclusively said.

Now, what's bugging here is our tendency to stick to absolutes. We have a legacy of non-conformity, of openness, of acceptance, of diversity, of flexibility... But we still want to stick to "the" oldest, "the" best, "the most" complete, and so on. Do we ever realise that such an attitude is unfair to even the human mind? While we have millions of options at our disposal, we want to pick one and stick to it.

For instance, yesterday, a friend of my colleague's said, 'Nothing can beat Delhi street food.' The first thing I wanted to ask her was, 'How many kinds of street food have you tasted?' Secondly, chances are, she went to Marina Beach in Chennai and asked for Chholē Baturē, and obviously, it did not taste as good as those at Karol Bagh. But no, we don't realise our error---the judgement: Delhi has the best street food. Probably, even saying something such as '_Roshan di Kulfi_ has _the best_ Chholē Baturē' is wrong. And without a doubt, such a statement is flawed because taste is subjective! But of course we don't realise our error. Why should we, right? "Be magnanimous to accept my flaws, now that you're being so open-minded anyway."

### The geography, and the civics

OK, not really. But let's look at what made India such a great subcontinent in the first place. Our location on the globe, going from the tropical to subtropical, to almost touching the temperate region, the varied landforms, and all of that. Obviously, this means we have different cultures, depending on whatever was convenient for the tribes living in that zone. So, instead of setting a bunch of hard-and-fast rules for everything, and make a single culture, we created some core values which were common to almost all of the regions of the empire (in those good old days) or the country (in today's sense). An example of these core values would be, "_Atithi dēvō bhava_", or, "Treat your guest like you'd treat God."

What we need to understand here is that the attitude of openness that we've carried through millennia is what made us survive for millennia. This automatically makes our new attitude of conformity counterintuitive.
