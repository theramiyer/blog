Well alright... I turn the chair abruptly and hit my elbow on the armrest. A shock wave runs thru my left arm which gives me mixed emotions.

Well, that's a very scintillating, chilling 'vibrant' start...lol.

Good morning, folks...this is my first on Blogger after some small ones on fb... ;)

Have a great day! ;)
