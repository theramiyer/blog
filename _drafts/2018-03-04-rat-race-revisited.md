At [Meraki Post](https://www.merakipost.com), we do paid reviews. Authors transfer a small sum towards supporting us maintain our site and stuff, in return for prioritised reviews. About a week ago or so, I received an email from this man, John Thomas. He said he'd spoken to Veena about the paid model, and he was OK to pay. Veena told me, "You can charge $10 from _Firangs_. This guy is an Indian." That was another way of saying, "Indian self-publishers cannot afford 650 rupees for a review." But it was too late. I'd already sent the email, and John had transferred the sum.

But when I read the first chapter, I justified the charge saying this book would be one of the cliched novels that we've all come across at some point in our life or another. I just let it be. I began reading the book.

Few pages down, I read a few things that I could totally relate to (and I'm sure every techie would be able to relate to). The first thing is the thought in the second or the third year that that is the end of our lives.

I am part of a small middle-class family. I'd never seen a glass building in the first eighteen years of my life. And mediocrity was the norm in the environment I grew up in. And we were told that we had to become the fastest rat. There was no dream better than that of being an engineer. I mean, that's it! That was the goal. And since it was Gujarat, a business side was also added to it. Nobody knew how to think outside of businessman and an engineer. Period.

Teachers kept saying, "You're worthless because you don't do math. You don't get physics. You run away from chemistry..." to me. I would never become an engineer. So screw it. That was the mentality I stepped into life with.

Loser, right? Without a doubt.

When I joined college, I understood how much of math I understood. I understood how much of physics I actually got. I realised that my teacher's ego stopped him from clearing my queries, and my laziness to actually sit down and read made me lose pieces in these jigsaws which in turn made me score less. But that did a good thing.

The college I joined was excellent. Luckily I chose the department I chose. When the right teachers came around and patted me, I understood I wasn't worthless after all. But I also knew that I was different. Fast forward to today, and I'm a happy techie who's actually good at and passionate about what he does.

I couldn't agree more. But let me elaborate.

The world around us millennials sucks. We're _born_ with expectations built around us. "My son will become an engineer, and one day, become a manager." I swear I've heard this several times from different people. It is so flawed and unfair... don't even get me started!

This is one of the reasons there are people like Chetan Bhagat who study in IIT, and then go to IIM to later join a bank. I mean what's the f**king point? 

"_Arey_, my son studied in IIT, a premium Indian institution, and then in IIM, another premium Indian institution."  
"Oh, that's so cool! What does he do now?"  
"_Arey_, he did so much for me, now I should let him do what he wants, right? He runs a premium coffee shop in Pune. Even Sharad Pawar _saheb_ goes to his store for coffee."  
\*Awkward silence\*

This is us.

The others? "My son is an Associate Operations Manager in `<insert the name of an IT services giant here>`."

When we stepped out of college and into these "IT companies", we were fascinated by the glass facades and stuff. It was all so cool! Four years later, I realised that glass buildings are among the most foolish things to construct in places like Chennai and Ahmedabad. I mean think about it: we're a tropical land, and hit temperatures of forty-seven degrees in summers. Glass lets the infrared radiation in, but not out. So glass buildings make sense in places like Canada, not in Mumbai. Our offices heat up insanely if the AC turns off for ten minutes. You superheat a room from one side and cool it from the other.

This is the product of mindless rat-race engineers, architects and decision-makers.

We are all raised with this sort of expectations. We move into IT with the expectation of a comfortable life, of speedy growth, and all of what the ones born ten years before us have. Why, _yesterday_, Dad's cousin wasn't ready to believe that I don't earn lacs a month. Yesterday! "Oh come on, IT engineer in Bangalore, seven years in the industry. Don't tell me."

Come on, man!

Some of us gullible kids buy into that, and when we don't see ourselves getting home at six in the evening, or buying a car by the second year, or a house by the fourth, or when we get up in the midnight just to fix a server's tantrums, we get frustrated. We didn't go to _work_ in these places, in the first place. Nobody told us about "working" in an "IT firm". We were shown only glass buildings, and white collars, and large payslips, and annual outings, and own cabins with a mini refrigerators, and a Honda Accord and a BMW, and a nice villa... But who spoke about work?

The result? We desperately wait for the weekend. Because that's when we break free from all this "work and shit". And work has to be "extracted" out of us. And there needs to be work -- life balance (more on why it is actually work-life balance sometime later).

Wrong. No work is easy. And you're better off doing what you like doing, rather than what pays you better.

"Whoa, whoa..."

IT isn't a piece of cake, just like anything else. If I were to tell you that you can be a billionaire in four years of being a politician, would you become a politician? No. Why? Because you know that there are chances that you get killed in the very first week of being a politician. Or that politics is not "your thing". Where was this reasoning when you joined IT?

I'm not saying that there aren't people in IT that make your life hell. There are. But those sadists are everywhere; not just in IT. Their stories go volumes, so let's not touch them for now.

How do I handle this? For starters, I love what I do. I wasn't lucky enough to get here right away, but I got here a few years ago. It took time and patience.

Second, work is not just the IT I do. I love computers and programming. And I express it in different, small ways. One of them is by setting up and maintaining Meraki Post.

Third, IT is not the only thing I do. I write. I edit articles. I experiment with podcasts. I read. I bike. I try out writing screenplays. I research things I want to write about.
